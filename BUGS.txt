- bug: SAXException2: A cycle is detected in the object graph. This will cause infinitely deep XML: br.unirio.wsimxp.entity.Scenario@3c7892f1 -> br.unirio.wsimxp.entity.Value@ff72b3b -> br.unirio.wsimxp.entity.Scenario@3c7892f1
- bug: scenario's values are not displayed
- bug (again): SAXException2: A cycle is detected in the object graph. This will cause infinitely deep XML: br.unirio.wsimxp.entity.Scenario@3c7892f1 -> br.unirio.wsimxp.entity.Value@ff72b3b -> br.unirio.wsimxp.entity.Scenario@3c7892f1
